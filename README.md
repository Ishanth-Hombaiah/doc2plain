## ðŸ§  Intelligent Translations
Doc2Plain uses **AI** to break down complex language into something anyone can understand. It does **more than just providing definitions**:

- Creates a logical cohesive structure (if this, then that) that reads naturally and is easy to comprehend
- Uses a sensitive tone to ensure a sense of calm and understanding
- Tries to be optimistic when it can, giving you a feeling of hope and positivity (which is really important in medicine!)

## ðŸ“š Go Deeper
Doc2Plain allows you to ask common **follow-up questions** after you receive your translation, such as:

- What are the next steps?
- Is this serious?
- I'm worried, what do I do?

Doctors often don't have time to provide more detail or answer many follow-up questions after their initial conclusion. But we do, and answering your questions helps you **take control and feel better about your medical situation.**<br/><br/>
